	        	<p>Trekking through the Himalayas is for those who prefer a less cosseted vacation. On the camping trek, we get up and go to bed with the daylight, and relax warm sunshine after a leisurely lunch.
                
                - We provide all camping and cooking equipment. These treks are staffed by a full local crew, including a main guide, porters, cook and assistants. •Your main baggage is carried by porters.It is the camp our crews’ job to perform all the camp work, including leaving the sites clean. Food on trek is a mixture of Western and local dishes with plenty of choice. Our menu is based on fresh food to provide three nutritious and tasty meals a day. We can cater for specific dietary needs if we know in advance. All trekkers are pleasantly surprised at the quality of the meals

	        	<p>As all our Annapurna/Everest Treks go above 2,000 meters, HETT – Nepal schedules are carefully designed to minimize the effects of Altitude. We ascendslowly, for safe acclimatization. Headaches and breathlessness (Benign Mountain Sickness) are common at altitude and are, in themselves, nothing to worry about. In rare cases, this may develop into Acute Mountain Sickness(AMS), so the Guide keeps a close watch on everybody, as he/she is trained to recognize the symptoms. If anyone shows signs of severe headaches, nausea, lethargy or  in extreme cases, ataxia (loss of co-ordination) and serious breathlessness at rest, they will be evacuated to a lower altitude immediately. The Guide’s decision on descent is final.</p>
